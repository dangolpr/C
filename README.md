# C
A collection of projects done with C 

Scribbler Robot:
This is a robot that we used for most of our projects in C in the course 'CSC 161: Imperative Problem Solving with C' , which can perform functions such as playing a sound at a specified frequency, taking a photo, and moving backwards/front/left/right. To control this robot, we used C along with the MyroC package which can be accessed here : http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/courses/161.sp18//MyroC-documentation.php
